## Primer concentration effect

Analysis of variation of coverage fraction upon variation of primer batches.

### Contents
* `predict_coverage.Rmd`: R notebook of coverage prediction (with wrangling and data viz)
* `primer_dimers.py`: analysis of effect of primer dimers
* `run_cov_prediction_batch.r`: runs coverage prediction for samples processed with different batches (random, G-rich, T-rich). Includes correlation between predicted and experimental coverage with all variations of G and T composition (to make accuracy plots).
